Recipe Master – Web App
Developed Using: Angular | TypeScript | Ionic Framework | HTML | CSS | JavaScript 

Introduction:
Recipe Master is a feature-rich web application designed to simplify recipe discovery and management. It allows users to browse, search, filter, and manage recipes, as well as add favourites, write reviews, and contribute their own creations.
Built using Angular and Ionic, the app focuses on delivering a visually appealing, mobile-friendly, and highly interactive experience, demonstrating strong front-end development and UI design skills.


Core Features
User Authentication:	Secure login and signup functionality.
Recipe Browsing:	Explore various recipes categorized by type (Desserts, Spicy, Fast Food, etc.).
Search & Filter:  	Quickly find recipes using search keywords or category filters.
Favorites:	Mark and view favorite recipes for quick access.
Add/Edit Recipes:	Add new recipes or update existing ones with custom details.
Review & Rating System:	Users can share feedback and rate recipes.
Responsive Design:	Optimized layout ensuring smooth performance on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Data Management:	Recipes stored and fetched from JSON or API (extensible for backend integration).


Technology Stack:
Angular: 	Component-based architecture and dynamic UI rendering
Ionic Framework:	Cross-platform mobile-first UI design
TypeScript	Strong typing and maintainable code structure
HTML5 / CSS3:	Page layout and responsive styling
JavaScript (ES6):	Logic implementation and interactivity



System Architecture:

Frontend: Built using Angular and Ionic for modular design and reusability.
Routing: Managed via Angular Router for seamless page navigation.
UI Components: Developed using Ionic elements for a native-like experience.


Learning Outcomes

Through this project, I enhanced my understanding of:
Angular component-based development and service integration.
Ionic UI components for responsive mobile-first design.
Data handling and routing in a structured single-page application.
User authentication and session management in a web context.
Clean code practices and modular architecture.


Future Enhancements
•	Integration with Firebase for real-time data storage and authentication.
•	Advanced filtering (by ingredients, diet type, and preparation time).
•	Image upload functionality for recipes.
•	Social sharing and community-based recipe discussions.
•	Deployment as a PWA (Progressive Web App) and Android/iOS app using Ionic Capacitor.


Conclusion
Recipe Master represents a practical implementation of front-end development principles.
It showcases my ability to design, develop, and deploy interactive web applications while maintaining clean code structure, visual appeal, and user engagement.
